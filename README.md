# Text Gradient On Scroll

Welcome to my collection of creative developers' works. This one features features text elements that dynamically adjust their opacity based on the user's scroll position. As the user scrolls down, the text gradually fades in, becoming fully visible at a defined point. Conversely, scrolling back up reverses the effect, smoothly fading the text out.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install framer-motion lenis sass
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

Now you are good to go.
